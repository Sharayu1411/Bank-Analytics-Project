# Bank-Analytics-Project

### Project Overview
- Created an interactive Power BI dashboard that is divided into three main sections: Home, Loan Overview, and Loan Segmentation.
- Utilized SQL for efficient data extraction and querying, which allowed us to handle large volumes of banking data.
- Employed Excel for initial data cleaning and preparation, ensuring smooth integration with Power BI for advanced visualization.

### Data Source 
Bank Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Finance_1.xlsx" and "Finance_2.xlsx" files, containing detailed information about members of the bank and their status.

### Tools
- Excel: Data Cleaning
- SQL: Data Analysis
- PowerBI: Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked with SQL.

### Key Features of the Dashboard
1. Home: Provides an at-a-glance view of key loan metrics such as total payments, revolving balances, loan amounts, and annual income, along with interactive filters for detailed analysis.

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:\
1. There is a steady increase in the loan amounts from 2007 to 2011, with a significant spike in 2011.
2. Loans are categorized by grade, with higher loan balances associated with higher grades (A and B).
3. The majority of last payments are associated with rent and mortgage, with very few for owned properties.
4. A significant portion of loans ($202M or 58.66%) are for verified accounts, while $142M (41.34%) are for unverified accounts.
5. A consistent increase in the number of fully paid loans is seen from January to December.
